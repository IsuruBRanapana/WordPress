1 -Font Awesome Free License
	-------------------------
	Font Awesome Free is free, open source, and GPL friendly. You can use it for
	commercial projects, open source projects, or really almost whatever you want.
	Full Font Awesome Free license: https://fontawesome.com/license.

	# Icons: CC BY 4.0 License (https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/)
	In the Font Awesome Free download, the CC BY 4.0 license applies to all icons

	# Fonts: SIL OFL 1.1 License (https://scripts.sil.org/OFL)
	In the Font Awesome Free download, the SIL OLF license applies to all icons

	# Code: MIT License (https://opensource.org/licenses/MIT)
	In the Font Awesome Free download, the MIT license applies to all non-font and
	non-icon files.

	# Attribution
	Attribution is required by MIT, SIL OLF, and CC BY licenses. Downloaded Font
	Awesome Free files already contain embedded comments with sufficient
	attribution, so you shouldn't need to do anything additional when using these
	files normally.

	We've kept attribution comments terse, so we ask that you do not actively work
	to remove them from files, especially code. They're a great way for folks to 
	learn about Font Awesome.
